# Favorites

The Favorites module allows you to easily organize frequently accessed items without having to navigate deeply between objects. To access this module, go to the Navigation section, identified by the symbol ![navigation](images/icons/navigation_icon.png) at the top of the screen, and then select the `Favorites` option.

You can select an existing folder or create a new one. To select an existing one, use the search bar marked `Filter by Folder Name`, where you can enter the desired folder name. Alternatively, you can click on the icon ![folder list](images/icons/folder_list_icon.png) to display a list of existing folders, as illustrated in Figure 3.

When you select an existing folder, the objects belonging to that folder are displayed along with their hierarchical structure, as indicated in Figure 4. When you click on a specific object, the Object Options Panel appears with the object's information, located on the right side of the screen and explained in detail in the [Navigation][navman] chapter. In addition, you will find the `Release From Folder` option, which allows you to delete the object from the selected folder.

You can create a new folder by selecting the ![create folder icon](images/icons/create_folder_icon.png) button where a new window appears requesting the name of the new Folder, as shown below.

You can edit the name of a folder by selecting it from the filter shown in Figure 3 and then clicking on the icon ![edit folder](images/icons/edit_folder_icon.png). This will display a window similar to the one shown in Figure 6, where you can enter the new folder name. Similarly, you can delete a folder by selecting the icon ![delete folder](images/icons/delete_folder_icon.png). It is important to note that these buttons to edit and delete a folder will only be available after selecting a specific folder; otherwise, they will remain disabled.
