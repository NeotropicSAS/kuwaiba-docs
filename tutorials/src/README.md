# Introduction
This book contains a set of tutorials showcasing several use cases where Kuwaiba can be applied effectively, as well as platform operation and development tips.

## Modeling
### DWDM Ring
This example takes three sites with DWDM multiplexers created from scratch and from a template, and connect them in a ring topology using the [Object View](https://kuwaiba.org/docs/manuals/user/navigation/navman/index.html#object-view) and the [Outside Plant Manager](https://kuwaiba.org/docs/manuals/user/physical/ospman/) module.

### VAS Platforms
This example showcases a way to model mobile [VAS platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_service). This is a beginner level example for users who wonder how to model applications and services.

## Platform Operation
### Bulk Upload
This tutorial describes how to run one of the data on-boarding examples available in the code repository, and sketches the basics of data ingesting in Kuwaiba.

## Development
### Creating a New Module
This example demonstrates how to extend Kuwaiba by creating a module using the **Integration API**, and manage inventory objects using `BusinessEntityManager`.
