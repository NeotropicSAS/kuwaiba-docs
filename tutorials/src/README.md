# Introduction
This book contains a set of tutorials depicting several use cases where Kuwaiba can be applied effectively.

## DWDM Ring
This example takes three sites with DWDM multiplexers created from scratch and from a template, and connect them in a ring topology using the [Object View](https://kuwaiba.org/docs/manuals/user/navman/index.html#object-view) and the [Outside Plant Manager](https://kuwaiba.org/docs/manuals/user/physical/ospman/index.html) module.
