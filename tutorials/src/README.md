# Introduction
This book contains a set of tutorials depicting several use cases where Kuwaiba can be applied effectively.

## DWDM Ring
This example takes three sites with DWDM multiplexers created from scratch and from a template, and connect them in a ring topology using the [Object View](https://kuwaiba.org/docs/manuals/user/navman/index.html#object-view) and the [Outside Plant Manager](https://kuwaiba.org/docs/manuals/user/physical/ospman/index.html) module.

## Creating a New Module
This example demonstrates how to create a Module in **Kuwaiba** and manage inventory objects using `BusinessEntityManager`.

## VAS Service - Basic example
This example demonstrates a proposal for modeling a VAP service. It is a basic example for someone starting their journey with **Kuwaiba**.
