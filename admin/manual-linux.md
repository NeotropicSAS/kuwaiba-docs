# Introduction

**Kuwaiba** is an enterprise-ready network inventory platform aimed to the Telecommunications industry, but easily adaptable to other contexts. It was designed to not only serve as an asset repository, but also to orchestrate complex business processes such as Service Provisioning, Activation, Modification and Termination, and to greatly speed the creation and integration of OSS (as in Operation Support Systems) applications.
